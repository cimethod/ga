# GA Library
It allows to developer using genetic algorithm library writes solution of problem in methods of optimization on the most different conjunctive and discrete problems.

## Introduction
The most of problems are regarding world of industrial engineering specially productive system, complex and absolute difference for solving by techniques common techniques of optimization. The interest of instance creates industrial industry of optimization on life of creatures for solving of the most kind of problem and increasing time lapse. The simulation of natrul evolution process becomes for alive creatures leading to the stochastic optimization of techniques which it is called by evolution algorithm. These can support the common optimization of methods while using on the different real problems. Genetic algorithm is to be able to say the most famous evolution algorithms.

## Features
### Three operators
Three operators called by mutation, crossover and initial sub-chromosome which the latest word is new operator at GA.
### Ease to use
It allows to use custom functions and routes what you want to do like changing and modyfing initial domain to forecast what will be to do. It also has tutorial to learn how to work and doing GA. For more further, click [api cimethod](http://api.cimethod.com/) link.
### Use to application
It presetns to real problem and better solutions to solving problems like game design and the formal software application.
